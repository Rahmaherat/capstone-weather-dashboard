1. Project Overview
The objective of this project was to design and implement a Weather Dashboard using React JS and optional Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to search for the current weather conditions of various cities, fetching real-time data from a public weather API.

Key features of the app include:

City Search: Users can input a city name to fetch the weather information.
API Integration: The app retrieves weather data using a third-party public API (such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI).
Responsive UI: The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and responsive across devices.
Deployment: The application is deployed for online access, allowing users to interact with the weather data through a live website.

2. Project Goals and Scope
The main goals of the project were:

Frontend Development: Implement the weather dashboard using React JS, focusing on creating dynamic and reusable components.
API Interaction: Learn how to fetch data from an external API and handle API responses asynchronously.
UI/UX Design: Create a clean, intuitive interface, ensuring it is responsive and user-friendly.
Deployment: Deploy the application on a platform such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, ensuring itâ€™s accessible online.

3. Technologies Used
React JS: For building the user interface with components and managing application state.
HTML/CSS: For structuring the app and styling the components. Optional: Tailwind CSS for faster, utility-first styling.
JavaScript (ES6+): To handle logic, asynchronous operations, and user interactions.
Weather API: A third-party weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) to fetch real-time weather data.
Deployment: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel to deploy the app live.
